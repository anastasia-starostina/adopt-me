# Key Takeaways 

- Learned new frameworks such as Redux Tool Kit, Vitest & React Query outside of the scope of what I have worked on previously. 
- Solidified understanding of effective state management in React applications with the use of hooks. 
- Expanded my knowledge of React hooks by learning the use cases of some of the more advanced hooks.
- Instead of building new features, this project was more focused on refactoring the existing build which provided new ways of solving the same problem.
- Addressed React performance by implementing code splitting so that the whole app loads async.
- Experienced benefits of TypeScript & its valid use cases in larger applications. Practised by refactoring the existing React components to TypeScript. 
- Learned strategies for testing custom hooks by 'faking a component' or using 'renderHook' in Vitest.
- Differentiated controlled and uncontrolled forms in React.
- Tried Snapshot Testing and learned about some of its tradeoffs.
- Was intentional with ESLint and Prettier configuration to help with the project objectives.
